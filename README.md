📡 Inter-VLAN Routing using Router-on-a-Stick (Cisco Packet Tracer)
📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the configuration of VLANs and inter-VLAN routing using the router-on-a-stick method in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Two separate networks (HR and SALES) are segmented using VLANs and connected through a single router interface configured with subinterfaces.

The goal of this project is to show practical understanding of:

VLAN segmentation

Trunking

Router subinterfaces

Inter-VLAN communication



This project demonstrates a fundamental enterprise networking concept: segmentation with VLANs and routing between them using a single router interface.
It reflects real-world small business network design and aligns with CCNA / Network+ networking principles.
